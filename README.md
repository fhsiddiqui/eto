# Predicting Yield and ETo of Rice
PREDICTING YIELD AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF RICE IN BANGLADESH PERSPECTIVE: A HYBRID MACHINE LEARNING MODEL


The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is widely recognized as a standard method for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ); however, its reliance on a complete set of meteorological variables limits its applicability in data-scarce environments. In this work, we propose a novel Residual Long Short-Term Memory (ResLSTM) model to estimate ET0 in the northwest region of Bangladesh. The model is designed to be feature-agnostic, enabling accurate estimations even when certain climatic inputs are missing—a common challenge in developing regions. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate the SHapley Additive exPlanations framework to analyze the contribution of each feature to the model’s predictions, revealing that solar radiation plays the most positive influential role. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our ResLSTM model outperforms both traditional machine learning algorithms and the empirical PM method, achieving a mean squared error of 0.009, an R2 score of 0.993, and a root mean squared error of 0.097 mm/day. Furthermore, we derive a symbolic approximation of the ResLSTM model, yielding a compact analytical expression f̃ (X) that replicates the model’s predictions with minimal error (MSE = 0.009, R^2 = 0.997).

Estimated ET0 values can be converted to crop-specific evapotranspiration (ETc ) by multiplying them with the appropriate crop coefficient (Kc ), which serves as a critical indicator of the actual water requirement of the crop, and which is one of the key input features that influence the rice yield. We extend our work by introducing a feature-agnostic ResLSTM model for rice yield prediction, which can make reliable predictions even with an incomplete input data set, making it adaptable for deployment in data-scarce agricultural regions. This model also outperforms traditional regression models.
